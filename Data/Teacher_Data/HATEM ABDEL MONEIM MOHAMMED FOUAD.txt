AgNPs have attracted particular attention of the researchers because of their exceptional and tunable surface plasmon reverberation (SPR) and their applications in bioscience. Therefore in this project we will adopt an approach involving reduction of silver ions using different materials to highlight the advantages such as no need to use high pressure energy temperature and toxic chemicals for such a synthesis and characterization it by UV–vis spectroscopy Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nanoparticles size analysis (Zeta potential).The systemic effect of AgNPs was further assessed in the fourth instar larvae of Ae. Albopictus and Cx. pipiens pallens by measuring the levels of total proteins and activity of two important marker enzymes: Acetylcholinesterase and α- and β-carboxylesterase. Overall the findings of the study suggest that the use of Cassia fistula-fruit pulp extract mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles can be used for controlling vector mosquitoes.实验室介绍:昆虫的种类超过地球上其它生物种类的总和，其数量占动物总数的四分之三以上。在昆虫中，有少数种类危害农作物、储藏物和建筑物，或传播人畜疾病；而绝大多数种类是为人类创造大量财富的益虫，如天敌昆虫、授粉昆虫以及可作为工业原料、医药和食品的资源昆虫等。此外，昆虫也是极为重要的科学实验动物。因此，昆虫与人类的生存和发展关系十分密切。发展农业昆虫与害虫防治学科，科学治理有害昆虫的发生与为害，充分发掘、利用和保护有益昆虫资源 对于保证食物安全和人体健康，促进农业和社会的持续发展，都是十分重要的。
