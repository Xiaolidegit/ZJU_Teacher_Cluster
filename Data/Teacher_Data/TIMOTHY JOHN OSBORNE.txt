TIMOTHY JOHN OSBORNE外国语言文化与国际交流学院外国语言文学语言学个人简介:I am an American from Colorado who has been living and working at ZJU now for four years. I did my bachelor’s degree in German at Colorado State University. My master’s and Ph.D. degrees are also in German but from Pennsylvania State University. My study of language has focused on the theory of grammar more specifically on syntax. I now specialize in natural language syntax. I investigate aspects of sentence grammar phenomena such as coordination ellipsis polarity word order etc. I am most established and known in the field of dependency grammar a particular theory of natural language syntax.       On a more personal note I like to hike and take long walks with my dogs (I am a dog and cat lover). When I was younger I was a devoted soccer player. At present I play for our departmental ping-pong team which is a lot of fun. I like to follow current events in politics and otherwise so I am an avid consumer of the news. Concerning pure entertainment I am a fan of Star Trek and the Lord of the Rings. 教学与课程:I teach two linguistics courses one on syntax and dependency grammar for master’s students and one on semantics for undergraduates. I also teach courses on the English language focusing most on public speaking.研究与成果:PublicationsSome representative publications of mine are listed next.
