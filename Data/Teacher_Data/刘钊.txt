For accepting this fellowship I cancelled the contract of Dahlem Research School POINT Fellowship.2015.11 – 2016.04    Dahlem Research School POINT Fellow at Freie Universitaet BerlinDahlem Research School POINT Fellowship was funded by the German Research Foundation and the European Commission. Approximately 20 such positions were awarded annually covering natural and human sciences. Shortly after I started this fellowship I also got the offer of Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship for Postdoctoral Researchers.2015.09 – 2015.11    Research Assistant at Freie Universitaet Berlin2013.09 – 2015.09    Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton UniversityI worked in the joint group of Prof. Ravin N. Bhatt and Prof. F. Duncan M. Haldane (winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics).2012.08 – 2013.08    Postdoctoral Fellow at Beijing Computational Science Research Center2010.10 – 2011.10    Exchange PhD student at Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik MunichI was supported by the Joint Doctoral Promotion Program between Max Planck Society (MPG) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Around 35 such positions were awarded annually.2007.09 – 2012.07    PhD student at Institute of Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)2003.09 – 2007.06    Undergraduate student at Department of Physics Nanjing University教学与课程:栏目建设中....研究与成果:研究兴趣I am a theoretical physicist with broad interest from strongly-correlated (topological) condensed matter systems disorder and localization to quantum information and quantum computation. I solve problems by both numerical (exact diagonalization density matrix renormalization group matrix product state algorithm etc.) and analytical methods. In the last five years I have deeply investigated two types of strongly-correlated topological phases – fractional quantum Hall states and fractional Chern insulators by state of the art numerical simulation techniques and the concept of entanglement from quantum information theory.代表作 (完整的论文清单可以在我的ResearcherID G-6267-2011中找到)1.
