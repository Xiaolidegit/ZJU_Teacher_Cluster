I will join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Lehigh University in August 2014.  According to the US News & World Report the overall ranking and ranking of the engineering program of Lehigh University in 2014 were 41 and 45 respectively. My group has been well funded by the US Department of Defense and National Science Foundation. We have developed an advanced microgrid testbed for smart grid study. We have been actively publishing in IEEE Transactions. All my PhD students are very productive and find their ideal jobs.  The RA positions are for PhD students who have received or will receive MS degree in power electronics power systems or control. If you have good GPA and decent TOEFL/GRE scores and are hardworking self-motivated and reasonable please email your resume to wliu@nmsu.edu. The start date is flexible. Exceptional BS students and visiting PhD students will also be considered.  -----Dr. Wenxin Liuhttp://www.ece.nmsu.edu/~wliuPh.D. Openings in New Mexico State University Research Assistantship Available   Research AreaWireless networks wireless sensor networks and network security  Expectations   1. M.S. in Electrical Computer Communications Engineering or related fields.   2. Research experience (some publications preferred).     3. Reasonable GPA GRE and TOFEL scores  Introduction of the universityNew Mexico State University (NMSU) is one of fifty nine universities classified by the Carnegie Foundation as Research-I institution (basically first-class in research) see http://www.washington.edu/tools/universities94.html. Currently there are more than 300 Chinese students studying in NMSU. Our department is one of the strongest in NMSU in terms of research funding.  Introduction of the PhD advisorI am currently a tenured associate professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I obtained my B.S from Tsinghua University and M.S. and Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology (ranked 3rd in graduate schools of engineering in US). I have cumulative research funding of more than US $1 million and have more than 30 publications in IEEE transactions and conferences.
