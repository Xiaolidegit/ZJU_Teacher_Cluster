鄢萌计算机科学与技术学院计算机科学与技术· 智能软件工程· 软件仓库挖掘· 经验软件工程个人简介:I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in College of Computer Science and Technology Zhejiang Univeristy advised by Prof. Shanping Li and Xin Xia. I got my Ph.D degree in June 2017 under the supervision of Prof. Xiaohong Zhang from Chongqing University China.My currently research foucuses on how to improve developers productivity how to improve software quality and how to reduce the effort during software development by analyzing rich software repository data. In terms of the techniques I am interested in adopting different data analytics techniques including data mining information retrieval machine learning and program analysis.研究与成果:JOURNAL1 Meng Yan Xin Xia Emad Shihab David Lo Jianwei Yin Xiaohu Yang.
