In the lung for example building and maintaining the organ structure involves stem and progenitor cells which divide to produce two different specialized cell types. Both the division of stem/progenitor cells and the balance between their self-renewal and differentiation must be tightly controlled  to ensure that our lungs always have the correct number and type of specialized cells. Defects in the balance between self-renewal and differentiation and/or misregulation of progenitor cell division lead to several changes of the lung structure that can contribute to the development of severe lung diseases including COPD emphysema and asthma. My laboratory investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms which controls stem and progenitor cell fate decisions and behavior in the developing and adult lungs. We are particularly interested in what mechanisms control the decision of lung progenitors to self-renew or to differentiate and what control stem cell behavior and the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. We also look at the pathways required for cell lineage specification in the lung. One of our major projects addresses the critical role of transcription factors and protein phosphatases in controlling stem/progenitor cell division and behavior during lung development repair and regeneration using the power of subject genetics (in both growing and adult lungs). This fundamental research is essential for understanding the changes that can occur in our lungs as they become diseased. Our work has a therapeutic application because it can lead to the development of cell-based therapies for lung repair and regeneration.主要发现: KEY FINDINGSl Protein phosphatases play a critical role in regulating lung stem cell fate and behavior as well as in several lung diseases.l Protein phosphatases are critical for epithelial barrier integrity and therefore for lung development and regeneration.l Six transcription factors are essential for the maintenance of stem cells in the lung.所获荣誉:2018             Invited Stream Leader on Developmental Biology the 4rd Annual Intl.
