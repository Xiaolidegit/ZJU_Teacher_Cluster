It has both nuclease and helicase activities and plays key roles in maintaining genomic integrity. It is involved in the nucleolytic processing of 5’ flaps during Okazaki fragment maturation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during homologous-recombination mediated repair and of stalled replication forks in the intra-S-phase checkpoint. Dna2 is also found in mitochondria and is required for efficient mitochondria DNA replication and repair. Interestingly Dna2’s function is closely linked to the ssDNA binding protein Rpa. It has been shown that Dna2 can trim Rpa-coated long 5’ flap and restores Fen1 processing of Okazaki fragments. In vitro Dna2 Rpa and the helicase Sgs1 (BLM in mammals) constitute a minimal complex that can carry out long-range resection. Resection is dependent on the nuclease activity of Dna2 and the helicase activity of Sgs1/BLM. Rpa is essential for supporting the helicase activity of Sgs1/BLM in part by sequestering the unwound strands and also for regulating Dna2 by blocking its 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity. Due to the difficulty of obtaining stable Dna2 protein (the iron-sulfur cluster in it is fragile) there were no reported structure studies of Dna2 reported in the past 20 years.To gain a mechanistic understanding of how Dna2 work on DNA we determined the structure of the intact Dna2-ssDNA complex (Fig. 1A). The structure revealed that the active site and most of the DNA-binding sites are enclosed in a narrow tunnel necessitating the threading of the DNA through a tunnel end to access the DNA binding sites. The structure also indicates that the translocase activity of the helicase domain does not drive threading.  A 5’ DNA end would have to thread halfway through the tunnel before it can access the helicase domain while the threading of a 3’ end starting at the helicase 2A domain would be opposed by the 5’ to 3’ polarity of translocation. Instead of translocation the helicase domain appears to be important for providing DNA affinity and for bypassing the 5’ RNA primer of Okazaki fragments. The structure also precludes the helicase domain tracking on DNA to any significant extent because the nuclease domain is ahead in the 5’ to 3’ direction of translocation. This is consistent with in vitro studies showing the Dna2 ATPase activity to be dispensable for 5’ flap processing and double strand break (DSB) resection. The requirement for DNA threading prompted us to investigate how Dna2 gains access to Rpa-coated DNA. I solved the structure of a complex between Dna2 α1-helix and the Rpa70 OBN domain both of which are flexibly-tethered and likely serve to recruit Dna2 to Rpa. I also established a second Dna2-Rpa interaction that helps to displace Rpa from the 5’ DNA end explaining how Rpa restricts the cleavage polarity of Dna2. How Rpa is displaced from ssDNA is a fascinating question for two reasons: first Rpa has very high affinity for ssDNA (~50 pM); second Rpa is ubiquitous many proteins have to displace it to gain access to ssDNA. Despite its importance understanding of the displacement mechanism was lacking our study fills the gap and provides a precise description of such mechanism.Structural and Biochemical Studies of mTORC2 complexPublications:1 Zhou C Pourmal S and Pavletich N (2015) Dna2 nuclease-helicase structure mechanism and regulation by Rpa. eLife e09832 2 Chan CM Zhou C* and Huang RH (2009) Reconstituting bacterial RNA repair and modification in vitro.
