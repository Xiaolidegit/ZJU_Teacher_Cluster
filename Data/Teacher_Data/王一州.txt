Drought and salinity have the most detrimental impact on the agricultural sector. Therefore the priority for our sustainable agriculture is to develop the new generation of crops that will be more resilient to drought and capable of coping with increasing salt concentration in the soil.                 Drought and salinity have the most detrimental impact on agricultural sector.       Stomata are pores that provide the major route for gaseous exchange across the impermeable cuticle of leaves and stems. They open and close in response to exogenous and endogenous signals and thereby control the exchange of gases most importantly water vapor and CO2 between the interior of the leaf and the atmosphere. Stomata exert major controls on the water and carbon cycles of the world and can limit photosynthetic rates by 50% or more when demand exceeds water supply.    Water transport across the plant     Guard cell transport is integral to controlling stomatal aperture. Guard cells surround the stomatal pore and respond in a well-defined manner to an array of extracellular signals including light to regulate its aperture. Guard cells coordinate membrane transport within a complex network of intracellular signals to regulate fluxes mainly of K+ Cl- and malate driving cell turgor and stomatal aperture.                                         Stomata Movements: (A) opening by uptaking ions; (B) Closing by Releasing ions.    Clearly understanding how guard cell ion channel functions in response to stress will have many benefits for our agriculture and allow for rational usage of water on arable and irrigated lands and improved crops that flourish regardless of global climate change.    Therefore our key research parts are :     I、The Plant Ion Channels Functions:    In plants a large number of different ion channels are embedded in the plasma membrane to transport various ions including K+ Ca2+ Cl- and the organic anion malate2-. The flux of any one ionic species passing through a channel is driven by solely by the electrochemical gradient force for these ions flux.                                                                                                                     The membrane system  and The Ion channel Structure   Potassium is a major element found in plant tissues and it functions in various physiological processes including photosynthesis protein synthesis activation of some enzymes phloem solute transport of photoassimilates and maintenance of cation/anion balance in the cytosol and vacuole. For guard cells K+ is an essential osmoticum for ionic charge balance and the opening and closing of stomata. Not surprisingly plants have evolved a large number of  K+ transporters to facilitate  K+ uptake and release across plasma membrane and its distribution around the plant. Two classes of  K+ ion channels have been well- characterized and are found in virtually all cells namely inward-rectifying and outward-rectifying K+ channels. Both classes of channels belong to the well studied Kv-channel family a superfamily of voltage-sensitive channels found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In guard cells like other plant cells the Kv-like channels divide between two groups. The inward-rectifiers contribute to  K+ uptake and are dominated by the KAT1 ( K+ channel of Arabidopsis thaliana 1) and KAT2 ( K+ channel of Arabidopsis thaliana 2) gene products. The outward-rectifiers regulate  K+ efflux and comprise the GORK (Guard cell Outward Rectifier  K+) channel protein.Plant K+ Channels Structures and I-V curvesVoltage clamping on guard cell  K+ Channels. (A) inward rectifier  K+ channel and (B) outward rectifier  K+ channel .    Anion channels at the guard cell plasma membrane divide between two major groups depending on their physiological characteristics. The first group is identified as the slow-activating or S-type anion channels and the second group is identified with rapid-activating or R-type anion channels. The R-type anion channels have also been named quick-activating anion channel (QUAC). These channels exhibit strongly voltage-dependent features: they activate on increasing membrane voltage beyond the range of -100 to -80 mV and inactivate within a few tens to hundreds of milliseconds at more negative voltages. R-type anion channels are permeable to a large range of anions including monovalent anions such as NO3- and Cl- as well as some divalent anions including SO42- and malate2-. Most important the R-type anion channels are regulated by anion concentrations on both sides of membrane.    The Slow or S-type anion channels were originally identified with a slow-activating and largely voltage-independent current that is strongly activated by Ca2+i in the micromolar range . These currents have since been shown to associate with the SLAC1 gene product and its homologues in Arabidopsis. The SLAC1 gene (SLOWANION CHANNEL 1) is required for stomatal closure induced by either high CO2 or ABA. By contrast with the S-type channels the molecular identity of the R-type anion channels remains unclear. It has been suggested that the ALMT12 (Aluminium-activated Malate Transporter 12) and other members of this Aluminium-activated Malate Transporter (ALMT) family contribute to this anion flux in Arabidopsis. We using voltage and patch clamp to identify ion currents from plant cells also using Xenopus Oocytes system to test ion channel functions.   II、The Guard Cell Modelling   The last half-century has generated a wealth of knowledge on guard cell transport signalling and homeostasis. This information resolves the properties of the major transport processes and metabolic pathways for osmotic solute uptake and accumulation and many of the signaling pathways that control them. Even so many of stomatal dynamics remain unresolved especially how the entire network of transporters in guard cells works to modulate solute flux and how this network is integrated with organic acid metabolism to achieve a dynamic range of stomatal apertures. Quantitative systems analysis offers an effective approach in silico to explore the link between microscopic gene function and the macroscopic characteristics of assimilation and transpiration. As a first step to bridging this gap in understanding the OnGuard software was developed for quantitative dynamic modelling of the guard cell.   The GUI outputs of OnGuard Software available at www.psrg.org.uk    This model was built explicitly on the wealth of molecular biophysical and kinetic knowledge for guard cell transport and metabolism that drives stomatal movement; it accommodates stomata of different plant species; incorporates real predictive power needed to guide experiments at the cellular and physiological levels. We addressed paradoxical observations associated with the Arabidopsis slac1 mutation. The slac1 mutant lacks the plasma membrane channel responsible for Cl- loss during stomatal closure but its absence profoundly affects both inward- and outward-rectifying K+ channel activities and slows stomatal opening. Analysis of the Arabidopsis guard cell sing OnGuard predicted the effects to arise from anion accumulation in the mutant which affects the H+ and Ca2+ loads n the cytosol in turn elevating cytosolic pH and Ca2+i  both factors that regulate the K+ channels. These predictions were confirmed experimentally with the study demonstrating that ‘clamping’ cytosolic pH and Ca2+i was sufficient to recover both the K+ currents and stomatal opening kinetics. More importantly this model also helps us addressed the question of whether guard cell function might be manipulated through genetic means to improve stomatal Dynamics. This study represents a crucial step towards the use of OnGuard modelling for in silico design and reverse engineering of guard cell physiology notably to improve water-use efficiency during photosynthesis. These results confirmed independent and concurrent experimental work that reported no substantial effects on water-use efficiency of overexpressing either the AHA2 H+-ATPase or the dominant K+ channels. Instead the modelling predicted that enhanced stomatal dynamics and gains in water-use efficiency were most likely to be realised through modification f the voltage- and K+-dependent gating of the K+ channels研究与成果:目前主要研究领域为植物离子通道结构与功能、作物逆境分子生理、作物非生物胁迫相关基因功能分、植物细胞信号传导及保卫细胞系统建模。近五年参与完成多项英国生物技术和生物科学研究委员会（BBSRC）研究项目。发表SCI收录论文16篇，其中第一作者8篇；参编专著2部。研究成果发表在《Plant Cell》、《Plant Physiology》、《New Phytologist》、《Nature Plants》、《Trends in Plant Sciences》等主要植物学期刊上。工作研究项目:承担科研项目在研项目：浙江大学百人计划启动项目：2018-2024，经费200万元，主持；国家自然科学基金面上项目（31871537）：“建立气孔保卫细胞与副保卫细胞系统模型以探索提高大麦水分利用效率的方法”  2019.01-2022.12 直接经费60万元，主持。发表论文:Peer-Reviewed Journals*Equal Contribution1.
