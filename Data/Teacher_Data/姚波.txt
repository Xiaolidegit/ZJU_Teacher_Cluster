However RCA technique suffers the limitation to detect short DNA or RNA molecules. For long nucleic acid molecules enzymatic restriction as well as heat denaturation process is usually required which makes the amplification not effective and strictly isothermal. In this article a simple and efficient one-pot self-primed isothermal amplification (SIA) was developed for detection of genomic DNA directly based on the combination of nicking endonuclease assisted strand displacement amplification (SDA) and exponential RCA. In virtue of numerous nicking sites on the genome a pre-amplification of the whole genome was performed through SDA with the specific cleaving of nicking endonuclease. Meanwhile the single strand DNA with HPV target sequence generated from SDA could hybrid with the circle probe as a primer and trigger the exponential RCA as a result of the existence of nicking endonuclease. As the reaction temperature and enzyme were the same the amplification could be operated in one pot. The reaction solution after amplification was added on the electrode for hybridization with the sulfydryl probe to achieve the electrochemical signal. Based on the isothermal amplification genotyping of HPV 11 16 18 and the detection of HPV 18 in Hela cell line were attempted with satisfied results. This approach should be a promising tool for pathogene detection in clinical diagnostics and researchBiosensors and Bioelectronics，Available online 10 October 2016Superior Electrochemical Properties of Polystyrene Gold Electrode Enabling Single Nucleotide Mismatch Discrimination of DNA sequence Based on Electron TransferDespite rapid progress in DNA biosensors by employing various materials as well as techniques fundamental studies on characterization of DNA-gold surfaces remain to be explored in order to further understand this system and improve performance. Most recently we developed a novel polystyrene gold electrode (PGE) demonstrated high capacity of DNA immobilization compared with traditional gold electrodes. Herein we reported the superior electrochemical characteristics of PGEs for example significant difference of current signals between Ru(NH3)63+ bound to DNA backbones and freely diffused in solution were observed indicating distinct electron transport pathway of two status of RuHex. Based on the advantageous electrochemical properties of PGEs we subsequently performed a perfect and mismatched hybridization assay. At room temperature discrimination of single nucleotide mismatch was achieved indicating electron transfer through DNA molecules produce different current signal on perfect complementary and mismatched DNA sequences. High specific surfacegoldelectrodeonpolystyrenesubstrate: Characterization and application as DNAbiosensorIn the past decades many efforts have been made to improve the sensitivity and specificity of electrochemical DNA biosensors. However it is still strongly required to develop disposable and reliable DNA biosensors for wide and practical application. In this article we reported superior electrochemical properties of an integrated plastic-gold electrode (PGE) fabricated in-house by chemical plating on polystyrene substrate. PGEs were found having extremely high capacity of DNA immobilization compared with gold electrodes fabricated by standard sputtering based photolithography. Unique nano structured surface was observed on PGEs through morphology techniques which would to some extend give an explanation to higher capacity of DNA immobilization on PGEs. A probable mechanism of carboxylic acid produced on polystyrene substrate after exposure to UV irradiation was proposed and discussed for the first time. This biosensor was applied to detection and manipulate of DNA hybridization. Detection limit of 7.2×10−11M and 1-500 nM of linearity range was obtained.Talanta152(2016)301–307Toward point-of-care testing for JAK2 V617F mutation on a microchipMolecular genetics now plays a crucial role in diagnosis the identification of prognostic markers andmonitoring of hematological malignancies. Demonstration of acquired changes such as the JAK2 V617Fmutation within myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) has quickly moved from a research setting to thediagnostic laboratory. Microfluidics-based assays can reduce the assay time and sample/reagent con-sumption and enhance the reaction efficiency; however no current assay has integrated isothermalamplification for point-of-care MPN JAK2 V617F mutation testing with a microchip. In this report anintegrated microchip that performs the whole human blood genomic DNA extraction loop-mediatedisothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) and visual detection for point-of-care genetic mutationtesting is demonstrated. This method was validated on DNA from cell lines as well as on whole bloodfrom patients with MPN. The results were compared with those obtained by unlabeled probe meltingcurve analysis. This chip enjoys a high accuracy operability and cost/time efficiency within 1 h. All thesebenefits provide the chip with a potency toward a point-of-care genetic analysis. All samples identifiedas positive by unlabeled probe melting curve analysis (n = 27) proved positive when tested by microchipassay. None of the 30 negative controls gave false positive results. In addition a patient with polycythemiavera diagnosed as being JAK2 V617F-negative by unlabeled probe melting curve analysis was found to bepositive by the microchip. This microchip would possibly be very attractive in developing a point-of-careplatform for quick preliminary diagnosis of MPN or other severe illness in resource-limited settings.Journal of Chromatography A 1410 (2015) 28–34 Printing 2-Dimentional Droplet Array for Single-Cell Reverse Transcription Quantitative PCR Assay with a Microfluidic Robot This paper describes a nanoliter droplet array-based single-cell reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay method for quantifying gene expression in individual cells. By sequentially printing nanoliter-scale droplets on microchip using a microfluidic robot all liquid-handling operations including cell encapsulation lysis reverse transcription and quantitative PCR with real-time fluorescence detection can be automatically achieved. The inhibition effect of cell suspension buffer on RT-PCR assay was comprehensively studied to achieve high-sensitivity gene quantification. The present system was applied in the quantitative measurement of expression level of mir-122 in single Huh-7 cells. A wide distribution of mir-122 expression in single cells from 3061 copies/cell to 79998 copies/cell was observed showing a high level of cell heterogeneity. With the advantages of full-automation in liquid-handling simple system structure and flexibility in achieving multi-step operations the present method provides a novel liquid-handling mode for single cell gene expression analysis and has significant potentials in transcriptional identification and rare cell analysis.Scientific Reports 2015 5(9551): 1-7Sensitive detection of microRNA by chronocoulometry and rolling circle amplification on a gold electrodeWe developed a quantitative detection scheme for nucleic acids combining solid-phase rolling circle amplification and chronocoulometry (RCA–CC). A gold electrode was directly formed on a polystyrene substrate as a cost-effective and flexible biosensor for sensitive detection of microRNA (mir-143) in blood samples.Chem. Commun. 201450 9704-9706Naked-eye detection of nucleic acids through rolling circle amplification and magnetic particle mediated aggregationWe are presenting a new method for sequence-specific and naked-eye detection of nucleic acids (NAs) through isothermal amplification and magnetic particle mediated aggregation. A padlock probe was designed to hybridize to specific sequence on target genes followed by ligation and rolling circle amplification (RCA). Magnetic particles (MPs) were then added into RCA products solution. MPs would physically combine with long linear DNA coils (such as products of RCA reaction) and form visible intertwined aggregates while no aggregate was observed in the absence of high molecular weight NAs (>1 kb). As little as 0.62 amol (124 fM) of target DNA molecules was detected by the naked eye. It was further applied to detect human papillomavirus type 18 gene in genomic DNA isolated from HeLa cells. This assay is sensitive and low-cost with minimal instrumentation revealing great potential for molecular diagnostics in developing countries and regions with limited settings.Biosensors and Bioelectronics2013 47(15): 515–519Nanoliter droplet array for microRNA detection based on enzymatic stem-loop probes ligation and SYBR Green real-time PCRIn this paper a nanoliter droplet array based on enzymatic stem-loop probes ligation and SYBR Green real-time PCR for quantification of microRNA was developed. By employing T4 RNA ligase 2 instead of T4 DNA ligase we designed simplified stem-loop probes to perform microRNA-templated DNA ligation and reduced the non-specific ligation of T4 DNA ligase. SYBR green I dye was employed instead of TaqMan probes in present miniaturized real-time PCR systems. Specifically we optimized the dosage of SYBR Green I dye in nanoliter droplet and verified the performance of this system by detecting synthetic mir-122 with a 6 logs dynamic range (from 1.5 × 105 to 1.5 × 1010 copies). Linear relationship of the standard curve (R2 = 0.9997) and high PCR amplification efficiency (96.83%) were obtained under the optimized conditions. We detected the expression of mir-122 across five mouse tissues and the result was consistent with that TaqMan microRNA assay. We think this miniaturized real-time PCR platform reduced the detection cost considerably thus showing the great potential to quantitative biology.Talanta2011 85(4): 1760–1765Nanolitre droplet array for real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactionRecently more and more effort has been put into the miniaturization of genetic tests such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) because it is no doubt a powerful tool for molecular diagnosis and quantitative biology. In this paper we developed a low density nanolitre droplet array generated on a chemical modified silicon chip for gene quantification. Reliable and sensitive two step real time qRT-PCR assay for microRNA measurement was performed within 500 nL droplets. It has a dynamic range of six orders of magnitude allowing for the quantification of microRNA input from 103 to 109 copies per reaction. We successfully applied the platform for quantitative measurement of mir-122 across five cultured cell lines. The minimum total RNA input was as low as 1 pg per assay which showed great potential for gene quantification at single cell level. We envision the droplet based qPCR chip would be a universal and low-cost platform for gene quantification in ordinary biological laboratories.Lab Chip 2011 11 1545-1549 Quantitative analysis of zeptomole microRNAs based on isothermal ramification amplificationTo date ∼700 microRNA (miRNA) molecules have been identified in humans. Accurate and sensitive quantification of miRNA levels will help unveil their biological functions. Here we extend the isothermal ramification amplification (RAM) approach to a sensitive and specific real-time assay for quantitative analysis of miRNA. This RAM miRNA assay is based on the threshold cycle (CT) principle similar to that of real-time PCR. It has a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude allowing for the quantification of miRNA input from 103 to 1010 copies per reaction (10 nM to 1 fM). The capabilities of discriminating single-base mismatch and distinguishing mature miRNAs from their precursors are achieved by coupling the reverse-transcription of miRNA to the generation of a closed C-probe rather than using expensive detection probes like in real-time PCR. Quantitative measurement of 5 miRNAs (mir-1 miR-122 mir-150 mir-143 and let-7a) across 12 mouse tissues is validated in total RNA samples without further purification. U6 snRNA snoRNA 135 and miRNA-191 could be simultaneously quantified as endogenous controls. These results suggest that our RAM miRNA assay might provide a universal tool for miRNA detection and functional studies to meet the needs for bench examination clinical diagnosis and on-site detection.RNA 2009. 15: 1787-1794Real-time polymerase chain reaction microRNA detection based on enzymatic stem-loop probes ligationMiRNAs (microRNAs) are a group of endogenous small noncoding RNA with the length of 18-25 nucleotides which have recently been demonstrated to play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. In this work we developed a simple sensitive specific and inexpensive assay through the combination of enzymatic probe ligation and real-time PCR amplification for the measurement of mature miRNAs. A couple of novel DNA probes with a stem-loop structure were implemented to reduce nonspecific ligation by at least 100-fold. The assay has several remarkable features including wide dynamic range low total RNA input (0.02-0.2 ng) distinct anti-interference from precursor miRNAs (signal-to-noise ratio > 500) and single-base mismatch discrimination among miRNA sequences. In addition a one-tube assay could be accomplished by designing a couple of universal probes which makes it feasible to examine the expression of a whole family of miRNA (such as let-7) at one time. Finally we validated the method for quantifying the expression of four mature miRNAs including miR-122 miR-1 miR-34a and let-7a across 10 mouse tissues where U6 snRNA could be simultaneously examined as an endogenous control. Thus this method revealed a great potential for miRNA quantitation in ordinary laboratory studies and clinical diagnoses.Anal Chem. 2009 Jul 1;81(13):5446-51 教学工作:1. 仪器分析 (本科生专业基础课程）主要介绍电化学、紫外-可见吸收光度法、红外光谱、原子吸收光谱、色谱和质谱 2. 化学生物学实验 （面向高年级本科生）负责其中三个实验：植物基因组DNA的提取与扩增；PCR-RFLP单核苷酸多态性分析；探究型实验：PCR技术鉴定转基因大豆实验用材料                                   提取产物                                        凝胶电泳 资料下载（2017）1.  植物基因组DNA的提取与扩增 课件   10.17-110.17-23. 生化分析/生命分析化学 （面向高年级本科生和研究生）生化分析中常用生物技术；核酸分析；酶分析；蛋白质分析；免疫分析课件及资料下载（2018）文献阅读2018.zip3.1 1-常用技术.pdf3.2  核酸分析生命分析化学-2.pdf3.3  酶分析生化分析-3.pdf3.4  生物传感生命分析化学-4.pdf3.5  免疫分析生命分析化学-5.pdf3.6  氨基酸蛋白质分析 生化分析-protein-1.pdf生化分析-protein-2.pdf 4. 中级化学实验I  原子吸收光谱测定饮用水中鎂离子 5.
